# Fix&Track 
Fix&Track is a fullstack web application which implements an MVC pattern to track maintenance repairs in a nursing facility. It helps the nursing staff report needed repairs to all facility Repairmen on duty for the day. I used Javascript/es6 for the frontend and Node, ExpressJS and MongoDB for the Backend. The view is using ejs which is a template/view engine. For styling i used Bootstrap 4 and sass.
